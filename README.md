# Crypto Arbitrage Scanner
Hello Trader! I developed **Arbitrage Scanner** for Major Exchanges.

**Arbitrage Scanner** based on Binance ( Scanning for currencies which are listed on Binance. ).
- [x] Binance
- [x] Coinbase
- [x] FTX
- [x] Kucoin
- [x] Gate.io
- [x] Bybit
- [x] Huobi

There are some incorrect outputs when **different tokens have the same symbol**.
There are some time outs on the program because of **api rate limits**.
